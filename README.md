# EDA on Titanic Dataset

### Problem Statement:
Perform Data cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/dat). Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

### Objective:
To conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset to investigate relationships between its features and uncover underlying patterns.

### Libraries Used:
- Numpy (for data manipulation)
- Pandas (for data manipulation)
- Matplotlib (for data visualization)
- Seaborn (for data visualization)

### Steps Involved:
1. Importing the Libraries
2. Importing the Dataset
3. Data Understanding
4. Handling Missing values
- 4.1. Handling missing values - Dropping
 - 4.2. Handling missing values - Imputing
    - 4.2.1. Feature Engineering
5. Data Preparation
6. Exploratory Data Analysis
7. Summary
